## Project Caelus Encoder PCB

**Project Description

This is a custom PCB we designed to streamline the control system for our liquid-fueled rocket tests. It combines signal encoding, ignition control, and ESP32-based automation into one board, letting us send multiple control signals through a single ethernet cable and run timed sequences automatically.

**Why we made it

Our previous setup was messy and inefficient; we had to use several long ethernet cables and manually flip switches during tests. This new design makes everything cleaner, safer, and more reliable by cutting down cable clutter and adding automated control for key parts like valves and the igniter.
